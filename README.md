# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose and background are well defined.

## Results :chart_with_upwards_trend:
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

Let's deep dive on the Stock Analysis we performed. 

## Summary 

Refactoring code comes with its advantages and disadvantages. A refactored code:
1. is more readable to a coder who may not be familiar with the code, 
2. reduces repetitiveness by defining more variables, and 
3. runs faster by making the code more efficient at the task it is assigned to do. 

On the other hand, refactoring code is time consuming. We're trying to achieve what we already have with a more efficient code. It begs the phrase, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." In the end, we are coders and trying to figure out easier and better ways to achieve a particular result is the name of the game.

There is a detailed statement on the advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script (3 pt).
